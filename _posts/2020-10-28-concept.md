### Retrofit to existing western style loo
Plastic or stone stool like structure  
Legs are raised up changing the sitting angle  
Sloped and rough from the top surface to provide better angle to feet to rest and better grip  
Elbows can be rested on the raised kneecaps for easier posture

## Concept4
### Redesign of western style loo
The seat is tilted at a slope and lowered to provide better angle for defecation  
Back rest and support provided to distribute the body weight to back and prevent from slipping back  
Hands rest provided to distribute load to arms and easier rising and sitting down

## Concept5
### Car lift inspired design
The seat has two side bars accompanying it. 
The seat can move up and down with the bars going accordingly.
When user sits bars go up, easing him/her into a lower posture.
To stand up, pushing the bars downward will push the seat up meaning less stress on knees.
