Comprehension involves analysing and completely understanding the problems faced by the users and listing out the causes behind them.

When we talked to some elder users, the problems faced by them are :
1. While using the Indian toilet, they need to bend their knee joints to an extent which causes pain in the old age.
2. As they were using the Indian toilet over the years, using Western toilets makes it difficult for them due to the posture leading to constipation.

These are two train of thoughts that we had :
1. Make changes to the indian seat and make it more convenient to use for people with joint problems
2. Make modifications to the western seat and try to bring the posture of indian style loo.

Current solutions available in the market are :
1. Handles on the sides of western seats, this help while sitting and standing up but it does not help with the posture.
2. There are chairs available to use with the indian toilets but they too do not help with the posture.
