After finalizing our champion idea, we went to some of the elders around us and showed them the sketch of our Car-Lift Design. We asked them if our product will solve their problems and what are the pros and cons in our sketch model according to them.

Here is a video of my grandaunt reviewing our sketch model. She has severe pain in knees, it causes her a lot of problem while sitting and standing up. Though she has had put a support on the side wall (as shown in the image below). When I showed her the sketch and explained the working of our Car-Lift Design, she appreciated our model and she believed that it would help her a lot, however she also stated that our model would require a lot of space and that common people won't be able to afford it as it consists of engineering technique which seems to be expensive.

"Mujhe lagta hai ki ispe karna to asan ho jayega, par patle log hi aaenge ispe to
Mai to phas jaunga. Aur ye side k dande se jo hain, ye neeche kar sakte ho tum asan hoga.
Baaki isko pakad k beta baithne mein bhi bohot asani aayegi. Aram se pakad k baith jaunga"
"Isko pakad k rakhna padega kya? Fir to haath dukenge beta."
Me: "Nahi nahi dada ji, ye bas khade hone k liye hai dubara"
"Accha, fir to badhiya hai, ispe itni unchai pe zor laga paunga?"
Me: "Haan, dekhne mein zyada lag raha, asli banega tab acche se pata chalega
Baaki lag to badhshah ki gaddi rahi hai ye. Accha lagega subha subha"
