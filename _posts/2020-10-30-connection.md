After finalizing our champion idea, we went to some of the elders around us and showed them the sketch of our Car-Lift Design. We asked them if our product will solve their problems and what are the pros and cons in our sketch model according to them.

Here is a video of my grandaunt reviewing our sketch model. She has severe pain in knees, it causes her a lot of problem while sitting and standing up. Though she has had put a support on the side wall (as shown in the image below). When I showed her the sketch and explained the working of our Car-Lift Design, she appreciated our model and she believed that it would help her a lot, however she also stated that our model would require a lot of space and that common people won't be able to afford it as it consists of engineering technique which seems to be expensive.
