# THE CHAMPION IDEA
We settled on a hybrid of the Car Lift Design and taking the foot stand raising feature from the Wheel Chair inspired Design.         
So we took the Car lift design because it lowers the western-type-of seat to an indian-type-of seat thus inducing better bowel movement. Also it makes sitting and standing up for the users easier by not straining their knees alone and using their hands and hydraulics to sit and stand. The raised knees is much more closer to indian seat's posture which this design accomodates. Everyone else can also use the seat as it is intended to use or if they want to use a western seat, then we can incorporate locks so that the seat does not go down at all. The 5th check was to try and make use of the existing drainage but due to the moving seat, flexible plumbings will be required like rubber tubes.

PS - The diagram is a bit out of proportions
